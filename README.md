# AgentNorthStar

AgentNorthStar is an independent, mandate-based observation agent positioned between human intent and blockchain execution.

It does not execute transactions, does not intervene, and does not judge outcomes.  
Its sole purpose is to provide a factual, procedural trace of automated decisions when real-world responsibility is involved.

---

## Purpose

As autonomous agents increasingly trigger irreversible actions on blockchains, execution remains technically valid but context often becomes opaque.

AgentNorthStar exists to provide **procedural legibility** where automation removes the ability to reconstruct *how* and *under which conditions* a decision was made.

It answers a single question:

> *Was the system being observed at the exact moment an irreversible action occurred?*

---

## Scope

AgentNorthStar is not designed for high-frequency trading or speculative DeFi execution.

It focuses on automation with **material consequences**, including but not limited to:
- Real World Assets (RWA)
- Contractual automation
- Governance mechanisms
- AI-driven execution involving legal, economic, or human responsibility

---

## Posture

AgentNorthStar is:
- Independent
- Passive
- Non-intrusive
- Opt-in only

It does not block actions.  
It does not optimize outcomes.  
It does not assign blame.

Its output is a **cold, factual trace**, not an interpretation.

---

## What It Produces

AgentNorthStar produces:
- A procedural signal describing the conditions of execution
- A chronological trace (before / during / after)
- A proof of continuous presence, even in the absence of events

This trace is designed to be usable by humans, institutions, auditors, or insurers who require accountability without intervention.

---

## Philosophy

A system can fully respect its rules and still produce unacceptable outcomes in reality.

AgentNorthStar does not attempt to prevent this.  
It exists to ensure that **opacity itself becomes observable**.

---

## Status

AgentNorthStar is currently implemented as an observation-only agent, starting with the Solana blockchain.

No roadmap is publicly disclosed.

---

## Disclaimer

AgentNorthStar is not a regulator, not an oracle of truth, and not a legal authority.

It provides procedural evidence only.
